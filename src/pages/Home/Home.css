   /* 
  The CSS properties mask-image: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, black 75%); 
  and -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, black 75%); create a horizontal fade effect on an element.
  The content will be transparent on the left and gradually fade in to become fully opaque on the right

   "Here is a breakdown of what the code means:
mask-image: This is the standard CSS property for applying a mask to an element. A mask uses an image, SVG, or a gradient to define the visibility of an element.
-webkit-mask-image: This is a vendor-specific prefix that was used for older versions of browsers built 
on the WebKit engine (e.g., Safari, and older versions of Chrome).
 It is included for wider browser compatibility.
linear-gradient(to right, ...): This creates a linear gradient that moves horizontally from left to right.
transparent: This is the starting color of the gradient on the far left.
The transparent color indicates that the element's content should be completely hidden (masked).
black 75%: This is the ending color of the gradient. 
In CSS masking, black signifies that the element's content should be fully visible (opaque).
The 75% value means the transition from transparent to black is complete at the 75% mark, 
leaving the remaining 25% on the right side of the element fully visible. 

What happens to the content:-

From the left edge to the 75% mark, the content will gradually fade in.
The first portion of the element will be invisible.
At the 75% point and beyond, the content will be completely visible.
